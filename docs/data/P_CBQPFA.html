        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for more details on the use of the data.</p>
<p>The Consumer Behavior Phone Follow-up Module - Adult (CBQPFA) section provides personal interview data for participants 16 years and older on various dietary related consumer behavior topics. Topics included in the section are: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Use of calorie labels on menus of various types of food-serving establishments (21 questions; CBQ506 &ndash; CBQ900);</li>
    <li>Knowledge of calorie needs (1 question; CBQ645); and</li>
    <li>Use of certain components of the Nutrition Facts Label (17 questions; CBQ700 &ndash; CBQ695).</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2007, a Flexible Consumer Behavior Survey (FCBS) module was introduced in NHANES. This module was developed in collaboration with the Economic Research Service (ERS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). It was designed to collect information on people&rsquo;s knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs toward nutrition and food choices.</p>
<p>The FCBS module has two elements: a core set of questions asked in the household interview, and a supplementary module asked in a 15-minute telephone follow-up interview with focuses specifically designed for each 2-year data collection cycle. While the core questions remained in the survey continuously, the supplementary module was conducted in 2009-2010 and again in 2017-2018 and 2019-2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data from the core set of questions in the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic FCBS module have been included in the Diet Behavior and Nutrition (DBQ), Consumer Behavior (CBQ), Income (INQ), and Food Security (FSQ) sections and released in separate files available on the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Questionnaire&amp;Cycle=2017-2020" target="_blank">NHANES website</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCBS supplementary phone follow-up module was designed to be administered differently depending upon the survey participant&rsquo;s age. For participants aged 16 years and older, we were interested in how their behavior related to their own diet and health. Therefore, the data were collected at person-level, meaning each participant answered the questions for himself/herself. For children aged 1-15 years old, the research interest was to see how the adults&rsquo; beliefs and behaviors can be related to the intake of children in the family. For example, the fast food buying habits of an adult may relate to the dietary intake of the children in the same family. Therefore, the FCBS phone follow up data were collected at the family level for children 1-15 years old. The questions were asked to one adult respondent in the family, the data were then linked to all eligible children in the home. The adult was not providing a proxy response for the child but giving his/her own information in this interview.</p>
<p>To be consistent with the design of the instrument, data from the FCBS supplementary phone follow-up module are released in two separate files based on the target groups: one dataset (P_CBQPFA) for survey participants 16 years and older, and another dataset (P_CBQPFC) for participants 1-15 years old.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similar to other datasets in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic release cycle, all FCBS related data files can be linked by the respondent sequence number (SEQN). For more information on the other FCBS related data, refer to the documentations accompanying the datasets.</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>All participants in the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic sample aged 1 year and older who complete a dietary interview in the mobile examination center (MEC) were eligible to participate in the FCBS follow-up interview. However, only data from survey participants aged 16 years and older are included in this dataset. Data collected for participants aged 1-15 years are released in a separate dataset&nbsp;(<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Questionnaire&amp;Cycle=2017-2020" target="_blank">P_CBQPFC</a>).</p><h2 id="Interview_Setting_and_Mode_of_Administration">Interview Setting and Mode of Administration</h2><p>The FCBS follow-up interview was administered to participants aged 16 years and older, over the telephone, after the day 2 dietary interview. (Note: The day 2 dietary interviews were conducted by telephone 3-10 days after the health examination in the MEC, but the timing varied.) After the day 2 dietary interview was completed, participants were given the option to continue with the FCBS interview or have it scheduled for another day or time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the questions were asked by trained interviewers using the Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing &ndash; CATI system. A hand card booklet was given to the participants before they left the MEC for them to use later during the follow-up interview. When necessary, the interviewers read the hand cards to respondents.</p><h2 id="Quality_Assurance_&amp;_Quality_Control">Quality Assurance &amp; Quality Control</h2><p>The CATI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data entry errors. CATI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in defining key terms used in the questionnaire. All of the data were reviewed by NHANES office staff for accuracy and completeness.</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>Frequency counts were checked, &ldquo;skip&rdquo; patterns were verified, and the reasonableness of question responses was reviewed. Edits were made to some variables to ensure the completeness, consistency, and analytic usefulness of the data. Edits were also made, when necessary, to address data disclosure concerns. When a variable was modified globally, as part of the editing process, the third letter in the variable name was changed from a Q (i.e., CBQ) to a D (i.e., CBD). For example, some data were collected using two variables (a number variable and a unit of measure variable) but combined into a single variable for data release purposes.</p><h2 id="Analytic_Notes">Analytic Notes</h2><p>The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12 locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally representative, these data were combined with data from the previous cycle (2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. The resulting dietary weights should be used to calculate estimates from the combined cycles. These dietary weights are not appropriate for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the previous 2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only participants who complete day 1 dietary interview in the MEC are eligible to participate in the FCBS follow-up interview. For the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic sample, there were 8,552 individuals aged 16 years and older eligible for the FCBS follow-up interview; of these, 6,806 were considered respondents for the FCBS. Dietary day 1 sample weights (WTDRD1PP) are recommended for use in analysis with data from the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic FCBS follow-up module (either alone or when the FCBS follow-up data are used in conjunction with MEC data). This set of weights was constructed by taking the MEC sample weights (WTMECPRP) and further adjusting for (a) the additional non-response and (b) the differential allocation by day of the week for the dietary intake data collection. For more detailed information on the dietary day 1 weights, refer to the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Dietary&amp;Cycle=2017-2020" target="_blank">documentation</a>&nbsp;accompanying the dietary datasets.</p>
<p>The order of the response categories for five questions (CBQ915, CBD925, CBQ738, CBQ698, and CBQ695) were randomized by household to minimize primacy and recency bias.</p>
<p><strong>CBD925 </strong>(What does the Daily Value mean to you)<br />
A derived variable, CBD925, was created by combining CBQ925 (collected in the 2017-2018 cycle) and CBQ926 (collected in the 2019-2020 cycle). FDA implemented the new Nutrition Facts Label with the required compliance deadline set by January 1, 2020, and most manufacturers implemented the new label by the end of 2018 or beginning of 2019. Therefore, the question CBQ925 was updated with the new food label sample in CBQ926 to reflect this change for the 2019-2020 data collection. Although the meaning of the question remains the same (i.e., what does the Daily Value on the Food Label mean to you), the sample labels are different. In the 2017-2018 instrument, the sample Nutrition Facts Label on food packages shows 5% Daily Value of vitamin A, while in the 2019-2020 instrument, the label shows 10% Daily Value of vitamin D (see table below for details). Given the same conceptual data was captured, these two items were combined and released in variable CBD925 in this public use dataset for the 2017-March 2020 cycle.
